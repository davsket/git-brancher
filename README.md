A recommendation is to surround your text by ", so you can add line breaks into it.

It will also suggest some prefixes to add to the branch:

```sh
$ branch Project-1440 Sign up screen alignment (iOS)
! Your branch name so far:
git checkout -b WFM365-1440-Sign-up-screen-alignment-iOS
? Would you like to add a prefix? (none)
